# CLI Marketplace - "üÖ±Ô∏èamazon"

Bamazon is a simple CLI app that lets customers purchase items from "Bamazon", the cool hip younger brother of amazon.com. This project uses a MySQL database to keep track of products and customer orders. In addition to purchasing from bamazon, the app features a manager view and supervisor view to perform more advanced functions such as adding more stock, creating new items to sell, and keeping track of profit margins.

## Customer View

When you initialize the app by calling ```node BamazonCustomer.js```as a customer, you'll be shown a list of products availale for purchase along with their ID and price. You'll then be prompted to select the id of the item you'd like to purchase and how many.

Once you make your order, you'll be shown the total cost of your purchase and given a log out message. The products database will update, depleting the stock accordingly. If you attempt to order more items than there are available, you'll be prompted to try again: <br>
