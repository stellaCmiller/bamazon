# CLI Marketplace - "üÖ±Ô∏èamazon"
Bamazon is a simple CLI app that lets customers purchase items from "Bamazon", the cool hip younger brother of amazon.com. This project uses a MySQL database to keep track of products and customer orders. In addition to purchasing from bamazon, the app features a manager view and supervisor view to perform more advanced functions such as adding more stock, creating new items to sell, and keeping track of profit margins.

## Customer View

When you initialize the app by calling ```node bamazonCustomer.js```as a customer, you'll be shown a list of products availale for purchase along with their ID and price. You'll then be prompted to select the id of the item you'd like to purchase and how many.

Once you make your order, you'll be shown the total cost of your purchase and given a log out message. The products database will update, depleting the stock accordingly. If you attempt to order more items than there are available, you'll be prompted to try again:<br>

## Manager Views

After initialization with ```node bamazonManager.js```, you'll be given a list of four menu items.<br>

### Display Stock
![](./readmepics/displayStock.PNG)<br>
This is similar to the customer view but with a key difference; the number of items in stock is shown along with the rest of the information from the products table.

### View Low Inventory
![](./readmepics/lowInventoryManager.PNG)<br>
This will display all inventory items with a quantity of less than 5. 

### Add Stock
![](./readmepics/addStock.PNG)<br>
You will be shown a list of item IDs to choose from, and then prompted to add the amount to restock.

### Add New Product 
![](./readmepics/addProduct.PNG)<br>
The program will walk the manager through all of the steps necessary to add another row to the products table. The item_id column need not be specified, since it will auto increment. You can see the product added to the table when you ask to view products for sale again: <br>
